                <p>Hello every, It&rsquo;s me again. I had a long study week at my university. It was fun to met my classmate  &lsquo;cause I have two month on my room. This was great to see my teachers in a real life, because I was boring with sit in front the screen all day to watch livestream and self-study. At that time, I proposed myself to self-study Javascript, HTML, CSS and PHP. However, the result is really bad, I played game the whole time.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s talk some subject I&rsquo;m learning at university, Marketing and PoC are not my favorite subjects, but I found my motivation on other skills, some guys too good at english and presentation skills.</p>
<p>Now turn to some specialized subjects, Network Communication quite familiar to me, because I learned CCNA before, but my teacher different on his&rsquo;s teaching way. Instead of explaning like a normal way, he ask our class by many quetions why. This leads me more interested, because I know the answers of the questions which nobody ask. The last subject is Wireless Communicaiton of my instructor, I prepared the knowledge before I came to class, but I faced surprise about lack of knowledge of some subject I can&rsquo;t enroll.</p>
<p>And I made a big mistake to believe someone who don&rsquo;t deserve, as a result, it&rsquo;s quite hurt and bitter.</p>
